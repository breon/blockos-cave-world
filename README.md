## World Setup
NOTE: Cave world is intended for Minecraft 1.16, when it comes out. I recommend using snapshot 20w17a for now as there is a bug that prevents you from catching fish in 20w18a.

The Cave World Challenge uses "buffet" world generation to create an enclosed plains biome.

* Select **Create New World**
* Select **More World Options...**
* Select **World Type: Buffet**
* Select **Customize**
* Select **World generator: Caves**
* Select **Plains**
* Select **Done**
* Select **Allow Cheats: ON** (just in case)
* Select **Create New World**

## Tips
* Content creators: The world is very dark. I recommend setting the gamma to 2.5 in `options.txt` initially. Close Minecraft before setting this.
* Find a village. There you will be able to find supplies, including saplings.

## Known Issues
* When playing with lower render distances, you sill be able to see the "outside" in the distance. This is some sort of issue with Minecraft. You can set your render distance to something higher in single player, but most servers only render 10-12 chunks. Additionally, you could disable the daylight cycle and set the time to midnight.
* Even though the overworld is encased in bedrock, occasionally some world generation will destroy some bedrock, enabling you to escape the cave world. Don't do this. It's not really in the spirit of the challenge. Future version may fill the top layer back in with a datapack.
